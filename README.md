# Rephrase.ai-Hackathon
Used the API provided by the Open AI and used it to form a stroy mode based around the text we recieve from the file
also then we formed another usage of the API by introducing gender specific to the text afterwards
we used the feature of extracting keywords from these text that can be use to obtain the relatable image to this text
then we agai  used an external library and found images in web that relate to these keywords and afterwords parsed these values in the parameters and obtained the function.
